With more than 30 commands, you can moderate your server, use utility features (Google:tm: search, user information, etc...) and even enjoy of fun stuff such as tags (ran by Lisa, a [JagTag](https://github.com/jagrosh/JagTag) port) and a (almost) unique cross-servers telephone.  
  
The project was born in **April 2017** and is still alive in **June 2018**. Star this repository if you enjoy the bot!
